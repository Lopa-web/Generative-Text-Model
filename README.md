"DESCRIPTION":This project involves creating a text generation model using either GPT (a transformer-based model) or LSTM (a recurrent neural network). The goal is to generate coherent paragraphs on specific topics based on user input.This project will develop a text generation system using either a GPT-based model (such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT-2/3, or fine-tuned GPT) or a LSTM-based model (trained on a dataset of relevant text). The system will allow users to enter prompts, and the model will generate relevant, structured, and readable paragraphs.
Deliverable:A Jupyter Notebook that loads and preprocesses data (if using LSTM, includes training steps).
Implements text generation using GPT (via Hugging Face/OpenAI API) or an LSTM-based model.
Allows users to input a topic and generates structured paragraphs.
Includes evaluation & fine-tuning steps.
